## Data Gathering

The following are some common techniques we use for initial data gathering.

### Start / Stop / Keep

Everybody writes one item per post-it, with something they'd like to Start doing, something they'd like to Stop doing and something they'd like to Keep doing.

e.g. Start monitoring servers, Stop turning up late, Keep writing tests first

Everybody sticks their post-its under the relevant section.

### What Went Well / What Didn't Go Well / Lessons Learned

Similar to Start / Stop / Keep, but with slightly different headings forcing you to think in different way.

### The Good Ship WDS

A picture of an old style sail boat is drawn, with wind in the sails, rocks behind, an anchor below and a tropical island ahead.  People write post-its for "Wind in the sails" (i.e. what propels us along), "Anchors" (i.e. what holds us back), "Rocks" (i.e. where we want to get away from) and the "Tropical Island" (i.e. where we are sailing toward).

An alternative is the Indiana Jones retro - a mine cart, hurtling down the tracks, with a big boulder following, and the bi-plane waiting to make your escape (mash up of multiple movies).

### Art Attack!

Instead of writing, attendees draw their experiences.  Optionally the room can be split into smaller teams, rather than individuals, and other rules such as when the pen lifts from the page, hand over to the next person.
